Generator for Mindestlohngesetz time sheets

Since 2014 anyone in Germany working near minimum wage is [required to document their working hours](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindestlohndokumentationspflichten-Verordnung) to ensure that their employer is not violating minimum wage laws. Unfortunately this creates a lot of annoying bureacracy for students working Hiwi jobs whose work time often doesn't fit their contract and thus have to make up hours.

This repo contains my implementation of a generator for automatically filling such time sheets with randomly generated working hours.

A complete implementation for filling time sheets provided by KIT is provided, filling any other PDF may require additional implementation work
